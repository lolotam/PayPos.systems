# Specification Quality Checklist: Resolve an attendance exception

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Business sections contain no implementation details; implementation decisions appear only under **Slice design**
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
- [x] **Slice design** complete: schema changes, API contract, permissions, events, and the test plan

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Edge Cases name the error codes so the integration scenarios (`RAE-*`) can assert them; this is deliberate and
  matches specs 027–033.
- All twelve owner questions are answered (RE-Q1–RE-Q12); no business rule is guessed.
- `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, so no before/after hooks ran.
